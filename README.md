<h1> Hi, I'm Alex Medebem</h1>

<body>  I'm in 9th grade and I attend a christian private school. I have 2 brothers, Michael and Gabriel. I play soccer and do track.
I am passionate about computer science engineering and digital photography. Right now I am learning how to use python and hope that in
a couple of months, I am very good at it and will be able to make a good website.
